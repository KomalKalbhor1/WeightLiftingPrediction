Practical Machine Learning Course Project: Weight Lifting prediction
================

The Short description
-----------------

This page presents my whole approach for solving Practical Machine Learning Course Exercise from Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera. Data Science and Practical Machine Learning creators are: 
**Roger D. Peng**, PhD, Associate Professor, Biostatistics; **Brian Caffo**, PhD, Professor, Biostatistics; **Jeff Leek**, PhD, Associate Professor, Biostatistics.
In this script I have used a specific approach for data exploration and cleaning and also my specific approach for model selection, training, cross-validation and finally testing. 
###Note: Some steps both in data exploration/cleaning and model training could have been omitted from this final "transcript" of my work, however I decided to include everything to present the approach, the order of the steps, the logical conclusions I derived from each step - even if some of those steps along the way have become partially or totally obsolete.
